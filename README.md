## [UE4-Inventory-Blueprints](https://github.com/matheusperches/UE4-Inventory-Blueprints)

#### Personal Unreal Engine 4 project of a six degrees of freedom spaceship.

#### Main feature

- Inventory systenm
  - Item picking / dropping
  - Limited storage based on item weight
  - Each item has it's own unique proprierties (weight, usable)
  - Usable items affect the character's stats
  - UI for inventory management with icons for specific items
- Highlighting & Usable system
  - Raycasting to get the 3d object information and limit interaction distance 
  - IF interactable, a highlight shows up
  - Item highlighting color changes based on item type (storage container, light switches or otehr pickup items)


#### Learnings
- Learned how to use blueprints system

- Learned about raycasting, item sorting and working with spawning and removing items from the game world properly

-  Approached the problem solution in the most organized way, as a slightly complex code in blueprints gets hard to read very quickly 

#### Room for improvement
- Fix the item duping issue when transfering inventory items into the ship container
- Add a simple hand animation when picking items up
- Add hotkeys to make interactions faster
